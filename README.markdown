Priest
======

The glue framework for web development.

Description
-----------

Monk is a glue framework for web development. It means that instead of
installing all the tools you need for your projects, you can rely on a
git repository and a list of dependencies, and Monk takes care of the
rest. By default, it ships with a Sinatra application that includes
Contest, Stories, Webrat, Ohm and some other niceties, along with a
structure and helpful documentation to get your hands wet in no time.

But Monk also respects your tastes, and you are invited to create your
own versions of the skeleton app and your own list of dependencies. You
can add many different templates (different git repositories) and Monk
will help you manage them all.

Priest is an extended monk commandline tool with functionallity not being
accepted into mainline monk. It is however compatible with mainline glue
and skeletons.

Usage
-----

Install the monk gem and create your project:

    $ sudo gem install rkh-priest
    $ priest init myapp
    $ cd myapp
    $ rake

If the tests pass, it means that you can start hacking right away. If
they don't, just follow the instructions. As the default skeleton
is very opinionated, you will probably need to install and run
[Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/), a key-value database.

Check the `dependencies` file in the root of your project to see what
else is there. Monk works with git almost exclusively, but your project
can also depend on gems. Check the dependencies file to see what options
you have, and run the `dep` command line tool to verify it.

Installation
------------

    $ sudo gem install rkh-monk
